# SQLWorkbase
SQLWorkbase, created in Java Swing, allows user to visualize their SQL Server databases and tables in a
table view by utilizing JDBC drivers. By entering their SQL Server username and password, users can access all their databases and tables,
which are displayed in a JTree Panel.
- Users can easily view specific tables by left-clicking on them in the JTree which will display the selected table in JTable.
- This program remembers the user's credentials, username and password, for future uses, making it more conveient to connect to the SQL Server.
- Key feature of this program is that it allows users to export the selected table as an excel file using Apache POI drivers , making it a convenient tool for managing and exploring SQL Server databases.
- The program has a proper exception handling mechanism, making it robust and user-friendly.
